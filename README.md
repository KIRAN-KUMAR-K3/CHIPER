## 🎓 Learn About the Algorithms

### Monoalphabetic Cipher
A substitution cipher that replaces each letter of the plaintext with another fixed letter based on a key.

### Polyalphabetic Cipher
A more secure substitution cipher using multiple alphabets to encrypt the message.

### Hill Cipher
A polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.

### Playfair Cipher
A digraph substitution cipher using a 5x5 grid of letters.

### Substitution Cipher
Replaces characters in the plaintext with corresponding characters from a substitution key.

### Transposition Cipher
Rearranges the letters of the plaintext to create ciphertext based on a fixed rule.
